# CueLayer Runbook

This document contains operational procedures for local development, session inspection, trace export, and explicitly authorized evaluation. It does not define product semantics.

## Local development

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Server-only environment values are documented in `.env.example`.

Current live development uses Speechmatics for realtime speech and OpenAI for teaching interpretation. Credentials must remain server-side; do not introduce `VITE_` client secrets.

## Learner and debug surfaces

- `/session` — normal learner surface.
- `/session?debug=speech` — explicit diagnostic surface for canonical speech / trace inspection and export.

The normal learner route must not automatically become a continuous transcript view.

## Speech path

The browser speech path must preserve the direct official PCM transport:

```text
AudioWorklet → usePCMAudioListener → sendAudio
```

CueLayer does not add custom VAD, endpointing, generic WebSocket protocol handling, or blocking trace work inside that handoff.

Current Speechmatics configuration is executable code/configuration. If documentation and code disagree, inspect the current implementation rather than treating this runbook as semantic authority.

## Session trace

Trace is local diagnostic evidence. Exported trace may include safe speech, checkpoint, request, provider, validation, accepted-event, state, render, and latency facts according to `docs/TRACE.md`.

Before sharing any trace externally, verify that it contains no credentials, audio/PCM, unsupported binary payloads, or private data that the task did not authorize sharing.

Trace is never domain replay authority.

## Repository validation

Run the repository checks appropriate to the change. For the current PR15 baseline these include:

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run eval:semantics:validate
npm run check:repo -- --clean
```

The clean check must leave the working tree unchanged. Generated evaluation output belongs under ignored `.cuelayer/` or `artifacts/`, not tracked source.

## Evaluation

Offline validation does not require provider calls:

```sh
npm run eval:semantics:validate
```

Paid provider evaluation, microphone/video playback, or private trace upload requires explicit task authorization. Do not infer authorization from a previous run, a command example, or the existence of credentials.

See `docs/EVALUATION.md` for the reproducible evaluation contract and compatibility boundary.

## Manual browser / audio diagnostics

When a task explicitly authorizes real browser/audio validation:

1. start from a clean working tree and record the exact branch/commit under test;
2. use the normal learner route unless the diagnostic specifically requires the debug route;
3. verify microphone permission and Speechmatics connection before interpreting downstream failures;
4. distinguish audio transport, ASR finalization, checkpoint commit, interpretation, validation, state publication, render, and DOM observation as separate stages;
5. export the trace only after the session if required;
6. do not classify synthetic/offline success as real microphone acceptance;
7. clean temporary local artifacts that are not intended evidence.

Browser/DOM latency observations are diagnostic proxies, not physical capture/display latency or human attention measurements.

## Failure triage

Use the execution chain rather than guessing from the visible surface:

```text
speech transport
→ ASR final
→ canonical checkpoint
→ pending scheduler
→ interpretation request
→ provider response
→ normalization / validation
→ durable accepted event
→ reduced lesson state
→ learner render
```

If an earlier stage has no evidence, do not diagnose a later stage as the root cause.

Provider timeout, malformed output, validation rejection, persistence failure, and renderer visibility failure are different failure classes. The learner should retain the last accepted surface while these are investigated.

## Replay compatibility

Historical accepted event versions that the runtime promises to support must remain replayable. Do not rewrite old accepted events or run current proposal validation over historical accepted payloads merely to simplify migration.

The upcoming Core-domain migration should introduce a versioned event/state contract and preserve legacy replay intentionally.

## Documentation boundary

Product direction and learner-experience decisions are maintained outside the repository. Repository documentation owns only executable system contracts, trace behavior, operational procedures, and reproducible evaluation definitions.

Use:

- `docs/SYSTEM_CONTRACT.md` — executable system authority and migration target;
- `docs/TRACE.md` — diagnostic trace contract;
- `docs/EVALUATION.md` — evaluation definitions/compatibility;
- this file — operational procedures.

PR descriptions, spike reports, benchmark run reports, and historical notes are not authority documents.
